## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- MongoDB Atlas account
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://sam:sam@cluster0.jx031pw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   JWT_EXPIRE=7d
   ```

4. **Start the server**

   **Development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Production mode:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🌐 API Base URL

- **Local**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Production**: `https://your-domain.com`

## 📱 Frontend Integration

The backend is designed to work seamlessly with the React Native mobile app:

- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests
- **JWT authentication** for secure API access
- **RESTful API design** for easy integration
- **Real-time data** with MongoDB Atlas

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs for secure password storage
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication with expiration
- **Input Validation**: Mongoose schema validation
- **CORS Protection**: Controlled cross-origin access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## 📊 Database Indexing

Optimized MongoDB queries with strategic indexing:
- User queries (email, userType, location, skills)
- Job searches (category, location, salary, experience)
- Product filtering (category, location, price, organic)
- Order tracking (buyer, farmer, status, dates)

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📈 Performance

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized query performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient MongoDB connections
- **Response Caching**: Strategic caching implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 5000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `JWT_EXPIRE`: Token expiration time

### Production Considerations
- Use strong JWT secrets
- Enable HTTPS
